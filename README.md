# LLM-for-Data-Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to streamline data analysis tasks, specifically focusing on:

- **Automated SQL Query Generation**
- **Dynamic Data Visualization**

Built for **Scibids (DoubleVerify)**, our goal is to make complex advertising datasets more accessible and insightful for stakeholders.

## üîß Current Implementation

### üóÉÔ∏è SQL Query Generator (`SQL Generator Code`)

We've developed a **dual-LLM prompt-flow** solution:

- **Table Recognition LLM**: Interprets natural language queries to identify relevant database tables efficiently.
- **SQL Generation LLM**: Generates accurate SQL queries based on identified tables and their schemas.

This two-step method optimizes SQL query generation by avoiding the common context-length limitations of single-step prompting.

### üìä Plot generator (`Plot_generator`)

Our Python visualization pipeline is designed to automatically:

- Generate SQL queries from user input.
- Execute queries and retrieve data from BigQuery.
- Generate initial data visualizations.
-give comments and analysis.
Currently serving as a proof-of-concept (our second implementation path), this component offers foundational visualization capabilities that can be significantly expanded in future iterations.

### üìä Feedback Loop (`Feedback_loop`)
To expand the dataset for model training, a feedback loop was incorporated, allowing the user to evaluate whether the generated query matches their intended query. If it does, the query is added to the dataset.

### sql_query_and_plot_generator

This project combines all the explored work into a final product that is capable of:

- **Generating SQL queries**  
- **Creating plot visualizations**  
- **Commenting on the results**  
- **Incorporating a feedback loop**: Users can evaluate whether the generated query matches their intended query. If it does, the query is added to the dataset, helping expand the model's training data.

The project brings together multiple components into a single solution for automated SQL query generation, data visualization, and continuous improvement through user feedback.


## üîÆ Future Enhancements & Roadmap

### üåü LangChain Integration

We propose integrating **LangChain** to significantly enhance our pipeline through:

- **Context Management**: Improved session continuity and context-aware responses.
- **Prompt Chaining**: Advanced logical reasoning through chained AI prompts.
- **Modularity & Extensibility**: Easier integration of additional data sources and tools.

### üìà Advanced Visualization Features

Potential visualization enhancements include:

- Integration of interactive visualizations using libraries such as Plotly, Dash, or advanced Streamlit components.
- Automatic insight extraction and annotation through advanced AI analytics.
